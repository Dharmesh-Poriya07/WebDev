# Async javascript

## What is asynchronous programming?
- Asynchronous programming is a means of parallel programming in which a unit of work runs separately from the main application thread and notifies the calling thread of its completion, failure or progress.
- Asynchronous programming is a design pattern which ensures the non-blocking code execution.
- Asynchronous programming is a means of writing non-blocking code by running a task on a separate thread than the main application thread and notifying the main thread about its progress, completion or failure.

## What is synchronous programming?
- Synchronous programming is a means of writing code which executes sequentially from top to bottom and blocking further execution until current execution is completed.
- Synchronous programming is a design pattern which ensures the blocking code execution.

## What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?
- Synchronous programming is a means of writing code which executes sequentially from top to bottom and blocking further execution until current execution is completed.
- Asynchronous programming is a means of parallel programming in which a unit of work runs separately from the main application thread and notifies the calling thread of its completion, failure or progress.

## What is the difference between asynchronous and non-blocking?
- Asynchronous programming is a means of parallel programming in which a unit of work runs separately from the main application thread and notifies the calling thread of its completion, failure or progress.
- Non-blocking code is a code which doesn't block the execution of further code.

## What is the difference between asynchronous and multi-threading?
- Asynchronous programming is a means of parallel programming in which a unit of work runs separately from the main application thread and notifies the calling thread of its completion, failure or progress.
- Multi-threading is a means of parallel programming in which multiple threads are spawned from a process and execute independently.
